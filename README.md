# Event-Tracker
##Problem Description
Certain people tend to have busy lives and forget about some important events as their best friends party, or their niece's graduation, etc. After forgetting some important events or remembering about them last minute tends to be super stressful and upsetting.
##Solution Description
To solve this problem I created an easy to use mobile app where the app users can track their events. They are able to add/see the name of the event, type of event, the location, the date, people attending and can mark it off once the event is attended.
